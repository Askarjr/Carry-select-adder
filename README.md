# Carry-select-adder
The idea behind a N-bit carry select adder is to avoid propagating the carry from bit to bit in sequence.  If we have two adders in parallel: one with a carry input of 0, the other with a carry input of 1, then we could use the actual carry input generated to select between the outputs of the two parallel adders.  One of those two will be correct, so they doesn’t wait for the carry out from each other. Then each one can processing immediately. But, how we know which adder’s output should be used.? We need a sub circuit that conceptually acts like a switch (multiplexer).
